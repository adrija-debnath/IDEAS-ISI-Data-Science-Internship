Predictive Maintenance Analysis
Project Type: Data Science Internship
Institution: IDEAS - Institute of Data Engineering, Analytics, and Science
Technology Innovation Hub: Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
Objective: Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Systems

Overview
This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance Analysis with the aim to develop machine learning models and data-driven insights that predict equipment failures in industrial settings. The project was undertaken as part of a Data Science Internship at IDEAS, a technology innovation hub at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

Project Structure
This repository includes the following main parts:

Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and prepare raw data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and analysis to explore patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering: Methods to create useful features from raw data.
Modeling: Machine learning models used to predict equipment failures or issues.
Evaluation: Techniques to check how well the models are performing (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).

Overview
This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance Analysis with the aim to develop machine learning models and data-driven insights that predict equipment failures in industrial settings. The project was undertaken as part of a Data Science Internship at IDEAS, a technology innovation hub at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

Predictive maintenance aims to reduce downtime, minimize repair costs, and extend the life cycle of critical equipment by predicting when and where failures might occur, allowing businesses to perform maintenance just in time before actual failures happen.

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
Pandas (Data manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning models and evaluation)
XGBoost (Boosting algorithms)

Results and Findings
The model's performance and accuracy depend on the quality and quantity of the data.
Key insights will be shared in the notebooks, including the most influential features for predicting failures.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score provided for model assessment.
